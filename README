ABOUT DOCUMENTATION: This is just a first stab at organizing documentation for
the DART system. The wiki pages, and Eduforge site will hopefully soon
have a group of users who can help in providing more detailed instructions,
as well as feedback on how DART can be most easily be documented.

To install the DART system:

Requirements:
- DART uses the SMARTY template system (download and install from www.smarty.net). You need to set the path to the SMARTY installation in lib/config.inc at the top of the file - require_once(PATH_TO_INSTALLATION/Smarty.class.php)

- Put all components in a directory that is assessible by a web browser running php/mysql. 
- Then use the lib/dart_create.sql file to create a sql database. 
- Set up the database access parameters and other machine specific information in the lib/machine.config.php file.
